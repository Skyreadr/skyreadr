## Hola! 👋
I'm Laura, Empathy Hacker at your service. 
I turn frustrating experiences into intuitive ones through thoughtful design (yes, that includes code). With a curious mind and a multidisciplinary toolkit spanning design, behavioral economics, gamification, and industrial engineering, I specialize in simplifying complexity and (re)designing systems that make life smoother, smarter, and more delightful.

### About my work:
- ⚡ My Superpower: Building bridges between disciplines – I ensure clear and effective communication across teams, disciplines, and cultures, translating complex ideas into practical solutions that everyone understands.
- 🌟 My design philosophy: “The alternative to good design is always bad design. There is no such thing as no design.” - Adam Judge. And yes, design includes research, strategy, copywriting, coding, and convincing others.
- 🚀 Favorite tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, Notion, pen & paper
